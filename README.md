# HIGHER-LOWER GAME

This game is based on a mixed idea of http://www.higherlowergame.com/ and the higher or lower card game.
The main difference is that you'll get a random number in a scale of 1 to 25 and you'll have to guess if the next random number is higher or lower. If it's a draw, you can keep going without loosing.

## Existing Features
### Header
   The header shows the game name "Higher-lower Game" on an image

### Buttons and number
    There is a start button that generates a random number and a higher and lower button that will generate a random number and compare it with the current one. If it's correct, it will show a "Hit" text, and if it's incorrect, an alert will show up saying that you missed it and which was the new number.

### Counters
    There are two counters: The "score" one, will sum the total score on the round. After loosing it will reset to 0. The "Record" counter, will save the highest score made.

## Features Left to Implement
The idea is to do it with cards, in a scale of 1 to 12 and showing the card symbols. (clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades)
